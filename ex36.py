# Exercise 36: Designing and Debugging



# Rules for if-statements

#   1. Every if-statement must have an else.

#   2. If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die functionin 
#       in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise.  
#       This will find many errors.

#   3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.

#   4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences.
#       Put blank lines before and after.

#   5. Your Boolean tests should be simple.  If they are complex, move their calculations to variables
#       earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.



# RULES FOR LOOPS

#   1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never.  This only applies to Python;
#       other languages are different.

#   2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number
#       of things to loop over.


# TIPS FOR DEBUGGING

#   1. Do not use a "debugger." A debuggger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick person.  You do not
#       get any specific useful information, and you find a whole lot of info that doesn't help and is
#       just confusing.

#   2. The best way to debug a program is to use PRINT to print out the values of variables at points
#       in the program to see where they go wrong.

#   3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them.  Do not write massive files of code
#       before you try to run them.  Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
