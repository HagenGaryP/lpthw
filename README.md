# Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, by Zed A. Shaw

I coded along with this book after already having knowledge of Python, but needed to refresh my skills on the subject.
I found that it was easy to follow along with, and actually quite enjoyable.

Not all notes are commented into the exercise scripts, and some scripts do not include the changes
from the study drills provided.  Although, the book's instructions were followed verbatim.
